# Final-Project
Capstone project for the final course in the graudate program in Analytics. I have worked with the group to summarize all the important outcomes on what the organization should take in their automation needs. This is done by implementing the cloud platform Microsoft Azure, and then import it to the programming tools using Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and AutoML.
